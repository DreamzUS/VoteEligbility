# VoteEligbility
Short program to test eligibility to vote in the United States
This program tests eligibility to vote in the United States. It is very, very basic and is the first full project I have ever coded.
It prompts the user to enter their age. If it is above 18, it asks if they are registered to vote.
They can answer yes or no. If no, it gives them a link to register.
